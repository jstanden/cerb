	You only need to understand a few concepts to get started:
	<ul style="list-style:square;">
		<li><p>A <b>ticket</b> is a specific e-mail conversation and all the related data about a question or issue.  Each ticket has a unique identifier for future reference by anyone involved.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the originating end of tickets are called <b>requesters</b>.  A ticket can have multiple requesters.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the answering end of tickets are called <b>workers</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>watcher</b> is a worker who receives copies of messages.  For example, a supervisor may be a watcher to monitor the quality of the messages workers are writing back to requesters.</p></li>
		<li><p>The <b>helpdesk</b> is a software hub for centrally managing and archiving tickets, and routing messages between workers and requesters.  This allows several workers to receive and share e-mail without requesters writing to any of them individually.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>bucket</b> is a container for storing similar tickets.  Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds and Spam.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>group</b> is several workers who share responsibility for the same tickets and buckets.  Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing and Corporate.  These examples are departments, but groups can be related by anything.</p></li>
		<li><p>A worker in a group is called a <b>member</b>.  A member with the authority to modify the group is called a <b>manager</b>.  Groups can have any number of managers.</p></li>
		<li><p>Each group has an <b>inbox</b> where new tickets are delivered by default.  These tickets are then moved into buckets either automatically by the helpdesk or by workers.</p></li>
	</ul>
