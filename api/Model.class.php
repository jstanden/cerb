/*
 * IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTE from your friends on the Cerb Development Team
 *
 * Sure, it would be so easy to just cheat and edit this file to use the
 * software without paying for it.  But we trust you anyway.  In fact, we're
 * writing this software for you!
 *
 * Quality software backed by a dedicated team takes money to develop.  We
 * don't want to be out of the office bagging groceries when you call up
 * needing a helping hand.  We'd rather spend our free time coding your
 * feature requests than mowing the neighbors' lawns for rent money.
 *
 * We've never believed in hiding our source code out of paranoia over not
 * getting paid.  We want you to have the full source code and be able to
 * make the tweaks your organization requires to get more done -- despite
 * having less of everything than you might need (time, people, money,
 * energy).  We shouldn't be your bottleneck.
 *
 * We've been building our expertise with this project since January 2002.  We
 * promise spending a couple bucks [Euro, Yuan, Rupees, Galactic Credits] to
 * let us take over your shared e-mail headache is a worthwhile investment.
 * It will give you a sense of control over your inbox that you probably
 * haven't had since spammers found you in a game of 'E-mail Battleship'.
 * Miss. Miss. You sunk my inbox!
 *
 * A legitimate license entitles you to support from the developers,
 * and the warm fuzzy feeling of feeding a couple of obsessed developers
 * who want to help you get more done.
