	<td>&gt; We planned to use ssd drives. Should we use RAID? Is 128gb drives
&gt; sufficient?

We recommend at least RAID-1 for mirroring so you always have a live replica of your data.  If possible, RAID-10 (mirror+stripe) will give you some added write performance as well as doubling the storage capacity (4x 128GB in RAID-10 is 256GB in the two-drive stripe with a mirror drive for each).

As far as capacity, 128GB should be fine with plenty of room for growth.  You just want to make sure you have enough space for binary logs, backups, attachments, etc.

Our own Cerb instance has history back to January 2002, and it's only a few GB.

> We have 31, but only up to 17 staff on the same shift.

That shouldn't be a problem.  There are plenty of Cerb installs with 50+ concurrent workers on a single machine.
