<H3>You are now operating in Free Mode</H3>

Each new Cerberus Helpdesk installation defaults to a "Free Mode" allowing nearly 
full-functionality with no expiration.  In this mode a tagline will be appended to all outgoing e-mail and you are limited to 3 workers. 
Companies with light requirements may find the free version does everything they need.  Go ahead, enjoy!<br>
<br>
For companies that need advanced functionality, or would prefer direct product 
support options, we offer affordable and flexible licensing options.<br>
